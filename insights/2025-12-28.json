    "form_response": "\nWhat happened was, in the morning, I did my evening puja, and in the evening, I did my morning puja because of time constraints in the morning. The morning puja is one hour long, so I couldn't afford to do that because I woke up late. So, I completed the puja and everything, and I fixed the errors in this workflow. That's as much as I did today.\n\nThroughout class, I was able to do a bit of work on this, so now I plan to spend more time on this, update and deploy the dashboard that has to do with this workflow, and once that is ready, I can basically update my resume and apply for Google Internships, which is the whole reason why I am focusing on this right now.\n\nAnd Bhagavad Gita classes haven't started yet, so I didn't take any. That's about it. I will continue to work on the other things right now, and for now, this is just a test entry to check whether the workflow gets triggered or not. Once it gets triggered, then I can continue to work on the dashboard and other such things. That's what this is about.\n\nIf possible in the future, I will try to integrate something where the continuous periodic notifications are not sent through Pushbullet but through WhatsApp because WhatsApp makes you feel a lot more like you need to open it and do it immediately. That's how I want to integrate this workflow into my daily progress and everything. So, yeah. \n\nI sang a few songs here and there. It doesn't count as formal music practice, but it still counts. If I have time after this, I will do music practice. If not, then I will sing a few more songs in order to make that count as music practice. ",
